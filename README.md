# House Renting Application

The House Renting Application is targeted toward UC San Diego students to find housing in the San Diego area. It aims to help users connect with other users through mutual interest in a listing. It also provides a platform for landlord users to post their listings.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
This project depends on `npm`, `docker`, and `docker-compose`. You may also want to separately install `MongoDB`, although this is not required it can be pulled by docker.

### Setup
Clone the repo from https://github.com/sakshisubedi/house-renting-application.

To view setup for `client` and `server` refer to their respective README's.
- Client README can be found [here](./client/README.md)
- Server README can be found [here](./server/README.md)

## Project Structure
This project uses the [React](https://react.dev/) framework for the frontend development and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) framework for the backend development. Additionally, it uses [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as a web framework for Node.js. So the directory structure follows:
- `client/`: frontend code
- `server/`: backend code along with MongoDB connection and schema definition for various collections
