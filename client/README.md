# Client
This is the frontend code of the House Renting Application written in [React](https://react.dev/).

## Getting Started

### Requirements
This folder depends on `npm`.

### Setup
- Run `nvm use` to temporarily set a specific version of Node.js.
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### Running the dev server
Run the dev server: 

```npm start```

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in the browser.

## Project Structure
This project uses the [React](https://react.dev/) framework/stack and so the directory structure follows the general React.js project structure. Some notable subdirectories of `src` include:
- `Components/`: Reusable React components.
- `img/`: Static images/assets like small logo images.
- `services`: API requests to backend services.

Generated directories include `node_modules`, `build`.
